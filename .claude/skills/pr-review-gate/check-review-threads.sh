# Fail while a PR has UNRESOLVED inline review threads.
#
# This is the enforcement half of the review rules in CLAUDE.md.
# A doc that says "read the inline findings before merging" cannot fire. This can.
#
# It exists because CI state says nothing about whether a review was ANSWERED.
# Ported from ejc3/fcvm, where a PR sat at 15 green checks / 0 failures /
# MERGEABLE with 19 unresolved inline findings, and another merged carrying four
# unread Major findings behind a green `CodeRabbit pass`. Codex reviews this repo,
# so the same shape is available here the moment a review has findings.
#
# Why GraphQL and not `created_at` heuristics: an earlier version of the docs
# said "comment older than your fix commit => already addressed". That is wrong
# whenever a fix addresses SOME of several findings — every older comment still
# predates it, including the unfixed ones, so unfixed blockers get classified as
# handled. `isResolved` is the only field that means resolved.
#
# Usage:
#   check-review-threads.sh <pr-number>          # query GitHub
#   check-review-threads.sh --from-file <json>   # parse a saved response (tests)
set -uo pipefail

# A GATE MUST FAIL CLOSED. Without this check the script degraded silently when `jq`
# was absent (it is not in the CI container): every `jq` call errored to stderr, the
# counts came back empty, and it printed "verdict: CLEAR ... exit 0" — a merge gate
# waving everything through precisely because it could not run. That is strictly worse
# than no gate, because it looks like one.
